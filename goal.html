    <h2 class="c1">Sustainable Development Goals</h2>
    <p class="c2">The sustainable development goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global goals adopted by the United Nations in
        2015 to
        end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity for all by 2030. Each goal has specific targets
        and indicators to measure progress and achievements. The SDGs are interlinked and interdependent, meaning that
        the success of one goal depends on the success of others.</p>
    <p class="c3">Transport is a key sector that contributes to the achievement of many SDGs, especially those related
        to climate
        change, energy, cities, health, and economic growth. By shifting to green transport, which is a way of
        travelling that reduces environmental impact, saves money, and improves health, we can support the following
        SDGs:</p>
    <br>
    <div class="c4">
        <div class="c41">
        <b>SDG 3:</b> Good health and well-being. Green transport can reduce air pollution, noise pollution, and traffic
        congestion, which can cause respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, stress, and accidents. Green
        transport can also increase physical activity, reduce obesity, and improve mental health, by promoting modes
        such as cycling and walking.
    </div>
</div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>SDG 7:</b> Affordable and clean energy. Green transport can reduce the dependence on fossil fuels, which are
    the main source of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Green transport can also increase the use of
    renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydro, which are cleaner and cheaper than fossil fuels.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>SDG 9:</b> Industry, innovation and infrastructure. Green transport can foster innovation and infrastructure
    development, by creating new technologies, products, and services that are more efficient and sustainable. Green
    transport can also enhance the quality and accessibility of transport infrastructure, such as roads, railways,
    ports, and airports, which are essential for economic growth and social inclusion.
    <br>
    <br>
    <B>SDG 11:</B> Sustainable cities and communities. Green transport can make cities and communities more livable,
    resilient, and inclusive, by improving urban mobility, reducing urban sprawl, and enhancing urban design. Green
    transport can also support the provision of basic services, such as education, health, and water, by improving
    access and affordability.
    <br>
    <br>
    <B>SDG 13:</B> Climate action. Green transport can mitigate the impacts of climate change, by reducing
    greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy efficiency. Green transport can also adapt to the effects of
    climate change, by increasing the resilience and flexibility of transport systems and services.
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>These are some of the SDGs that can be achieved if we shift to green transport. However, there are many
        other SDGs that are also relevant and important for sustainable transport, such as <strong>SDG 1 (No
            poverty), SDG 5 (Gender equality), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG 10 (Reduced
            inequalities), and SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production)</strong> . You can learn more about
        the transport relevance of each of the 17 SDGs from this document. You can also find more information about
        the SDGs and their progress from this website. I hope this helps you to understand the linkages between
        green transport and sustainable development.

    <h2>Why choose green transport?</h2>
        <p>Green transport is a way of travelling that reduces your environmental impact, saves you money, and improves your health. Here are some benefits of choosing green transport options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Reduce greenhouse gas emissions:</span> By using public transit, cycling, walking, or carpooling, you can avoid burning fossil fuels and emitting harmful gases that contribute to global warming.</li>
            <li><span>Save money:</span> By using green transport, you can save on fuel costs, parking fees, tolls, and vehicle maintenance. You can also take advantage of discounts, subsidies, and incentives offered by some governments and organizations for using eco-friendly modes of transportation.</li>
            <li><span>Improve your health:</span> By using green transport, you can increase your physical activity, reduce your stress levels, and improve your mood. You can also avoid exposure to air pollution, noise pollution, and traffic congestion that can harm your health.</li>
        </ul>
