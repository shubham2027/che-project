                <p>Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) Pod Cars are small, automated, and driverless vehicles designed for
                    point-to-point transportation within urban environments. Operating on elevated tracks, these
                    electric
                    pods
                    offer a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional public transportation. PRT systems aim
                    to
                    reduce congestion, enhance mobility, and provide a personalized, on-demand transit experience for
                    users.
