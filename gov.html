    <h1 class="c1">Initiatives taken by Government so far</h1>

    <p>The need for initiating a National Electric Mobility Mission Plan was understood back in 2013, aiming to achieve
        national fuel security by promoting hybrid and electric vehicles in India. This not only focused on boosting
        faster adoption of EVs, but is also a step towards meeting the country's pledge to reduce carbon emissions and
        reach the net-zero carbon emissions target by 2070. The good news is that the government has taken multiple
        steps to accelerate and provide incentives to stakeholders and partners in the ecosystem for faster adoption of
        EV. A few to mention -</p>
    <ul>
        <p>
            <li>The Government launched National Electric Mission Mobility Plan 2020 to provide subsidies for Faster
                Adoption and Manufacturing EV (FAME) schemes- subsidies for electric two and three-wheelers, hybrid
                cars, and E-cars.
            </li>
            <li>Under phase two of FAME- Rs 8597 crore has been approved for incentives and Rs. 1000 crore has been
                allocated for the development of robust charging infrastructure around the country.</li>

            <li>Fiscal incentives to promote the EV industry - Road tax exemption under EV policy has been given to the
                14 states like Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra,
                Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, and Uttarakhand, who have implemented EV policies
                and 4 states are at the drafting stage as of now.</li>

            <li>Battery swapping policy - the Government will formulate a battery swapping policy considering space
                constraints in urban areas</li>
        </p>
    </ul>
